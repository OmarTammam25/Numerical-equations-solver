# Introduction
This project is an application that solves linear and non-linear equations and is enhanced with the capabilities of root finding. The application is implemented using Python and PyQT5.

# Algorithms
The following algorithms have been implemented for solving equations:

- Gauss
- Gauss-Seidel
- Gauss Jordan
- Jacobi iterations
- LU decomposition using 3 different types: Cholesky, Crout, and DooLittle form  

For root finding techniques, the following algorithms have been implemented:

- Bisection
- Fixed Point iterations
- Newton Raphson
- Secant

# Features
The project comes with the following features:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles application
- Step-by-step simulation mode in the terminal
- Pivoting and scaling in Gauss and other similar methods for better accuracy with the solution
